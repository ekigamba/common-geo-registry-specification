## About 

The common geo-registry specification seeks to define the API and data specification for communication between the common geo-registry and other systems such as the geospatial widget. There are three primary interface layers that are the subjects of this specification. 
1. RESTful Geo-Object Server Specification to/from RESTful Geo-Object Mobile Interface
2. RESTful Geo-Object Mobile Interface to/from Mobile Host Application
4. Mobile Host Application to/from Geospatial Widget SDK
